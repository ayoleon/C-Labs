# C Programming Labs
This repository contains my C programming lab assignments for **[CS222 - Programming in C/C++, Cayuga Community College]**.  
Labs demonstrate fundamental concepts of the C language, such as functions, loops, arrays, pointers, string manipulation, and recursion.  

All programs in this repository were written and tested in **Microsoft Visual Studio**.  
They may also compile and run in other environments (such as GCC or Clang).

## Contents
> Each lab folder (or `.c` file) contains source code and may include a README explaining the specific problem and solution.

## Key Concepts Practiced
- **Loops** – `for`, `while`, and `do-while` structures for repetition  
- **Arrays** – storing and manipulating collections of characters and numbers  
- **Pointers** – working with memory addresses and dynamic behavior
- **Functions (Methods)** – modularizing code into reusable components  
- **Recursion / Recursive Functions** – solving problems by having functions call themselves, e.g., converting numbers to different bases  
- **String Manipulation** – custom functions for reading, reversing, and modifying text  
- **Input/Output** – safe user input handling with `fgets()` and formatted output  

## How to Compile and Run
### Using Visual Studio
1. Open Visual Studio.  
2. Create a new C project (Console Application).  
3. Add the `.c` file from the desired lab.  
4. Build and run (`Ctrl + F5`).
